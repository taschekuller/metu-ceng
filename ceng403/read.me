The folder consist of naive solutions for MLP, CNN and Finetuning for ResNet.

The 1:
  - Implement necessary PyTorch library capabilities for our works

The 2:
  - With using The 1 implement MLP 

The 3:
  - Naive approach for CNN without additional matrix-vector multiplication
  - CNN with Pytorch
  - Finetune ResNet
